# NeuromatchDeepLearningProject
Neural Decoding

In this project, we are going to predict some behaviors (pupil size, running speed, ...) of mice from neural activities recorded from the visual cortex.
This is the final project of the Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning course (2023)

We are going to use the Stringer dataset:

They also provided some useful codes for downloading and working with this data:

The following references are interesting studies that used the Stringer dataset:
